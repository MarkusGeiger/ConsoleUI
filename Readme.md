# ConsoleUI

This project contains some tests and implementation templates to get a rich and upgraded user experience in terminal applications. 
Any application that just needs some user interaction can be improved with some little tweaks.

Applications that inspired this project are for example:
* docker cli: When running docker build, the output stays mostly inside the current console screen without scrolling. Instead the log messages run through in the range of 10-15 lines in between. 

Possible libraries/frameworks
* [gui.cs](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/gui.cs): Complete TUI imoplementation using ncurses on Unix 
* [Spectre.Console](https://spectreconsole.net/quick-start): Modern console features for improved user experience
* [Sharprompt](https://github.com/shibayan/Sharprompt): Multiple prompt options for user input
